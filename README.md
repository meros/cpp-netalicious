netalicious
===========

The idea is to wrap boost::asio in a dead simple/clean layer of code while still maintaining a good amount of flexibility and power.

Obviously it's not there yet...

To build this, you need maker, another project of mine. Just git clone maker in a folder next to netalicious and it should work:

/workspace/netalicious

/workspace/maker

Then create a build folder and run cmake from there on the /workspace/netalicious folder just like any other cmake project
